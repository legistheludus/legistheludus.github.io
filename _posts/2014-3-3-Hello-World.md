title: What does it mean to be human?
---
Human consciousness equals awareness. What is awareness? It is the acknowledgment that we as conscious humans have the power to experience the universe before us. 
At any given point within the spacetime continuum, we are exposed to multiple events unfolding before us. To experience the universe fully, we can do two things: 
1. Choose which event we wish to engage in. 
2. immerse ourselves into the chosen event.

# Peripheral Awareness 
The choice of engaging in a particular event necessarily presupposes an awareness on our behalf. Only when we are fully aware, can we appreciate what the universe has to offer. 
This is what I call "Peripheral Awareness". A form of consciousness which is holistic and which involves using our cognitive faculties. 
# How to access such awareness? 
In order to access this, we need to direct our awareness to a single event. We then use this event as an anchor to observe other events occurring before us.
Think of this single event as a fulcrum. It helps us observe the universe subjectively through an objective lens. 
The good thing is we have the luxury of choosing our own fulcrum. However we can go a step further. We can focus our attention on **any** event before us. Including of course our fulcrum event. 
# Letting go 
Once we decide to focus our awareness onto a particular event, we also have the power to let go of events we do not wish to engage in. 
The choice of choosing one event is analogous to to opportunity cost. We can choose any event based on the opportunity cost of engaging in that event. This is of course a subjective process. 
# Immersive Awareness
The next step is to direct that same awareness into the chosen event. This form of awareness is a degree deeper than the Peripheral awareness. Lets call this "Immersive Awareness". 
In order to fully immerse ourselves into the chosen event, we need to access our peripheral awarenss once again. Only this time, we use it to shut off unwanted internal events ( Our thoughts). 
This activity is conflicting in nature because it requires that we engage both our peripheral and immersive awareness at every moment in the spacetime continuum. 
# Concluding Remarks
Initially it is difficult to activate even our peripheral awareness. But with practice, our subconcious takes over and becomes accustomed to handling both any any given moment. 
Immersive and Peripheral awareness go hand in hand. One cannot exist without the other. Yet one ought to keep in mind not to let one overpower the other.
